    #   Python code to compute the xml and image files for the megacities javascript table
    #
    #   This code downloads data from the USGS web site 
    
    #   The results of the calculation are contained in the HTML-Javascript "Megacities_Nowcast.html".  Place
    #       The folder "Data" and this HTML code into your web root directory for best results.
    
    #   The data for the web site is generated by invoking the command line prompt in a terminal window:  python Megacities.py
    #       The results are placed in the Data folder.
