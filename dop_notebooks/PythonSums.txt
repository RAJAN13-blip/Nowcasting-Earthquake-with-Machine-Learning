Python sums:

You have an array:   x[i][j]

To sum the elements of the rows (index i):

sum(x[i,:])     ...(1)

To sum the elements of the columns (index j):

sum(x[:,j])     ...(2)

If i is space and j is time, then summing over space is (2), we still have the time index j.
Summing over time is (1), we still have the space index i.
